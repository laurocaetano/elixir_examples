Elixir Examples
===============

The intent of this repository is to serve as an entry point for learning Elixir. It
provides a series of exercises - from basic to intermediary - as unit tests. Your
responsibility is to make the test cases pass, providing a correct implementation
for each case.

If you don't have previous knowledge in Elixir, you can start by reading the
[Getting Started](http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html) section
or the [Learning](http://elixir-lang.org/learning.html) section from the Elixir's
webiste.
